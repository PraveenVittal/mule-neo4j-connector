=== SME on the Platform
There is no expert for Neo4J but, if you have inquiries, ask any of the connector developers.

== Slack Channels

* Connectors Support Channel - https://mulesoft.slack.com/archives/connectors

== Sandbox
There are one Standalone AWS environment used by Engineering team.

**Environment installed is configured and maintained by Mulesoft**. Any requirements and problems related to sandboxes are tracked in https://www.mulesoft.org/jira/browse/N4JC[Neo4J] project.

For continuous integration and local testing of the Neo4J connector, we use the following sandbox:

* Neo4J Version: Neo4j 3.2.0 CE
* Host: ec2-54-88-71-203.compute-1.amazonaws.com

== Authentication Methods

=== Available for the Platform
Neo4J supports one form of authentication:

* *Basic Authentication*: The 'username' and 'password' are the "master keys" to the Neo4J environment. To authenticate, both are set to the username and password respectively of an HTTP Basic authentication scheme. These values can be gotten by Neo4J DB Administrator.

NOTE: Refer to https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/security/authentication-authorization/introduction/[this link] for more information on Neo4J's API authentication.


=== Currently Available in the Connector
The Neo4J Connector v1.0.0 *only* implements the  *Basic Authentication*.

== Troubleshooting

=== Logging Level

Package/s to log:

* org.mule.modules.neo4j.internal.connector.Neo4JConnector
* org.mule.modules.neo4j.client.Neo4JClientImpl
* org.mule.modules.neo4j.connection.basic.BasicAuthenticationConnection

=== Communication Debug
For all the operations, you can capture the requests in the class *Neo4JClientImpl*, which use the Neo4J Bolt SDK.

== Entry Points

Most of the logic constructing requests, sending and receiving messages from the server is done in class `org.mule.modules.neo4j.client.Neo4JClientImpl`.

The main way to better understand how to put the breakpoints is to go to the processor that needs debugging and see which method it is using from *Neo4JClientImpl*.

== Logging from Platform Side

There is no way of logging activity from the platform side
